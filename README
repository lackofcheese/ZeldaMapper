An automated mapper for Zelda and ZeldaC (NES), and possibly other games
of a similar nature.

Take screenshots in-game and the mapper will automatically update the png
map files; use the command-line interface to tell the application when
to change map (e.g. for dungeons or to record what's in the grottos)
