An automated mapper for Zelda and ZeldaC (NES), and possibly other games
of a similar nature. The idea is to generate a map using only what you've
seen so far, thus avoiding any spoilers you'd get by looking one up on the
Internet.

Take screenshots in-game and the mapper will automatically update the png
map files; use the command-line interface to tell the application when
to change map (e.g. for dungeons or to record what's in the grottos)
